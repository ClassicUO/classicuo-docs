# Overview
If your shard ruleset requires disabling certain UO features for gameplay reasons you can use the Shard Rules feature to
restrict what ClassicUO settings they can change, and/or set the default values.

## Creating shard rules
To set the rules for your shard, simply head over to the `Rules` section of the [Shard Management](https://play.classicuo.org/shard-management) for your shard.
