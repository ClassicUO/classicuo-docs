# Players FAQ

### How do I file a bug report?

If you run into a bug please file an issue on our github: https://github.com/ClassicUO/classicuo-web/issues

### Do I need to download files every time I open the game?

No, the client files are stored locally inside your Chrome storage. You can see the on-disk usage at the bottom of the server list.
Optionally you can clear the storage, but this will of course result in needing to re-download the files next time you click Play.

### Will there be an assistant like Razor?

A web based assistant is in development at the moment which will support similar functionality to Razor.

### Why can't I open the global map?

There's a complicated bug preventing the texture generation of the global map at the moment. It's on our roadmap to fix.

### How can I increase my FPS past 60/120/144?

Currently, Chrome uses VSYNC which locks your FPS to your monitors refresh rate, e.g. 60HZ -> 60fps.
You can unlock your FPS using Chrome flags, though we don't officially support that, and it's probably not necessary.

### Can I use multiple accounts?

ClassicUO Web supports multiple tabs open, however you will see reduced performance as a result. 
Always check your shards rules first.

### What do I do if the game freezes?

You will need to refresh the tab and reload into the game. If you can reproduce the crash please file a bug report on Discord.
