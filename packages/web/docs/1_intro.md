## Philosophy

At its heart ClassicUO Web aims to be a more accessible and easy way to play UO, similar to that of Oldschool Runescape.

Additionally, we want to facilitate better integration for shard owners to create their own unique experience using the latest web technologies within ClassicUO Web.
It's also a core focus for us to make the game more robust against cheaters with an always up-to-date unified client.
