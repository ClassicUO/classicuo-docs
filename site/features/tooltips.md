# Tooltips

Essentially these replace the existing dated UO tooltips with a complete web version rendered by the browser.

**Enable `ModernTooltips` under `Experimental` in the game options to use.**

## Highlights

- Sleek interface, with better readability
- Item/equipment icons
- Comparisons against equipped items (hold CTRL), showing expected stat changes
- Colour based on item rarity (if your shard sends a colour, e.g. like UOAlive)
- Reworked tooltip texts (left aligning numbers)
- Highlighting for positive/negative modifiers
- Durability meter
