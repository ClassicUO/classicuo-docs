## Highlights

- UI for Creating/Editing Tabs
- Custom message filters, e.g. type != "Label".   
  There's a few templates to choose from as examples, and the filterable properties are shown in the UI.
- Chat prefix for all messages you send on a Tab, e.g. for UOAlive's global chat you would use `[c`
- Customizable font, size and weight
- Large message history (up to 1,000)
- Enable displaying timestamps on messages
- Lock position toggle, so you don't accidentally move it
- Clear chat button to wipe the chat history
- Input history navigation:
  - via arrow keys (like in a terminal), up for the last message, down for more recent
  - Standard UO hotkey `CTRL + Q` for last message (`CTRL+W` is not possible due to hardcoded browser hotkeys).
- Autocomplete for previous messages, just type the first few letters then hit tab
