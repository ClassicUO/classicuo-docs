## Options

### Adding items

You can add items by clicking the above icon in the options.
Or if you're using Grid Containers you can add them directly in the corpse window.

### Grab bags

By default, your top-level backpack is used as the destination for all items.
It's common to organise loot into separate bags for selling to vendors etc.

You can do this by replacing the destination bag on the right of the item in the options.

### Item filtering

Sometimes items of the same type have differing names or hues, causing the Autoloot to skip over them.
Tou can make the item filtering less strict by toggling the filters next to the item, namely:

- Ignore name
- Ignore hue
