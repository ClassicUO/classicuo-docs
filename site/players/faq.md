# Players FAQ

### Can I play use the web client on the official Ultima Online servers?
Yes, as of recently the web client has been sanctioned for use on the retail servers.
See the [FAQ (Sanctioned) page](https://classicuo.org/players/faq-sanctioned) for more information.

### How do I file a bug report?

If you run into a bug please file an issue on our github: https://github.com/ClassicUO/classicuo-web/issues

### Do I need to download files every time I open the game?

No, the client files are stored locally inside your Chrome storage. You can see the on-disk usage by clicking on the
profile icon at the top right of the side menu.
Optionally you can clear the storage, but this will of course result in needing to re-download the files next time you
click Play.

### Why do I need to log in using Discord?

**Discord authentication helps us prevent abuse of the client**, and curbs cheating as shard owners can choose to ban people
via Discord account rather than just an IP which can be easily changed.

The client also store user profiles in the cloud, so you can go to any device and keep your same macros,
scripts, hotkeys from device to device.

### Will the web client support Razor?

Short answer, no. There will likely only ever be one assistant for the web client (the built-in one).

### How can I increase my FPS past 60/120/144?

Currently, Chrome uses VSYNC which locks your FPS to your monitors refresh rate, e.g. 60HZ -> 60fps.
You can unlock your FPS using Chrome flags, though we don't officially support that, and it's probably not necessary.

### Can I use multiple accounts?

ClassicUO Web supports multiple running clients via multiple tabs, however you will see reduced performance as a result.
Always check your shards rules first on their policy around multi-boxing.

### What do I do if the game freezes?

You will need to refresh the tab and reload into the game. If you can reproduce the crash please file a bug report on
Discord or Github issues.

### What do I do if the game runs poorly?

You can try to check if the `Hardware acceleration` option is enabled in your browsers settings.
