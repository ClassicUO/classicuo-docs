# FAQ (Broadsword Sanctioned version)

### Can I play use the web client on the official Ultima Online servers?
Yes, please see the FAQ on the [official uo.com wiki](https://uo.com/wiki/classicuo-web-client/).

### Does the web client have an assistant (like UOAssist)?
Yes, but it has certain features restricted/disabled when playing on the official Ultima Online servers, 
based on Broadswords' preferences.

### Why are certain features disabled on the web client when playing on official Ultima Online servers?
Broadsword desires to restrict/disable various features they deem to give players unfair advantages. 
This is a necessary condition of the web client being sanctioned for use. It's not something we can change.

### What features does the web client have?
Almost everything from the desktop client (high FPS, zoom, unlimited window size, etc.) as well as web-only 
features seen on the left under _Features_.

### Is the web client secure/safe to use?
Yes, Broadsword has access to the source code and has vetted it as safe to use.
Broadsword remains aware of any changes to the web client.

In some ways the web client is safer than the desktop client as it runs inside the browser, 
it cannot do anything harmful to your computer, like any other website you would visit.

We do not save any personally identifiable information, or share your data with 3rd-parties.
The only data we store about you is your discord username/id. We will only contact you via our Discord 
server with announcements, or in the web client itself.

### Does the web client replace the existing standard retail clients?
No, it is an alternative and does not replace the standard Classic client or Enhanced Clients.

### Why is the ClassicUO team working with Broadsword, are you compensated in any way to produce the client?
No, we receive no compensation in any way from Broadsword.

We build the client on our free time as a passion project. We have agreed to their conditions and the extra work of being
a sanctioned client so people can play without fear of repercussions.

### Why is the ClassicUO web client allowed but the desktop version isn't?
The desktop version was deemed unsuitable as it can be easily modified to enable unfair features.
The web client has built-in feature restrictions that Broadsword controls to only allow features fair for gameplay.

### Can I bring my ClassicUO desktop settings over to the web client
Yes, you can import them. Click on your display picture in the top right and select the "Import from desktop ClassicUO" button.
