# FAQ (Broadsword Sanctioned version)

### Can I play use the web client on the official Ultima Online servers?
Yes, please see the FAQ on the [official uo.com wiki](https://uo.com/wiki/classicuo-web-client/).

### Does the web client have an assistant (like UOAssist)?
Yes, but it has certain features restricted/disabled when playing on the official Ultima Online servers, based on Broadswords' preferences.

### Why are certain features disabled on the web client when playing on official Ultima Online servers?
The UO Team has decided to restrict/disable various features they deem to give players unfair advantages. 
This is a necessary condition of the web client being sanctioned for use. It's not something we can change.

### What features does the web client have?
Almost everything from the desktop client (high FPS, zoom, unlimited window size, etc.) as well as web-only features seen on the left under "Features".

### Is the web client secure/safe to use?
Yes, the UO Team has access to the source code and has vetted it as safe to use.
Broadsword remains aware of any changes to the web client. 

We do not save any personally identifiable information, apart from your discord username/id.
We will only contact you via our Discord server with announcements, or in the client itself.

### Does the web client replace the existing standard retail clients?
No, it is an alternative and does not replace the standard Classic client or Enhanced Clients.

### Is the ClassicUO team compensated in any way to produce the client?
No, we are working with the UO Team purely out of our own free time. 
We want people to enjoy the web client without fear of repercussions.

### Why is the ClassicUO web client allowed but the desktop version isn't?
The desktop version was deemed unsuitable as it can be easily modified to enable unfair features.
The web client has built-in feature restrictions that Broadsword controls to only allow features fair for gameplay.
