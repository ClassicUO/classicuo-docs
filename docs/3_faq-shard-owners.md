# Shard Owners FAQ

### How can I add my shard to the server list?
Right now we're keeping the pool of servers small for testing purposes. 
Please send an expression of interest to KARASHO' and we'll add you to our list.

### Will ClassicUO Web be open-source?
We don't currently have plans to open-source the web client. Though we do have plans to allow customization by shard owners.

### I have custom MUL/UOP files for my shard, can I use them with the web client?
We have a working version of file patching, we will release more details soon.

### I have a customized ClassicUO client for my shard, how can I modify the web client?
We're working on exposing tools to shard owners for adding custom UI and interactivity powered by React.   
However, we need to work on sandboxing the environment to keep players browsers secure and preventing cheats from being created.  

Our tooling is still very early in the prototype phase so for the short-term we only support servers who can use unmodified clients.
